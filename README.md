This repository contains a comprehensive algorithmic trading strategy inspired by the Paris Trading model. The strategy is built to leverage arbitrage opportunities in stock or forex markets, focusing on capturing small price discrepancies between related financial instruments.
Overview of Pairs Trading Strategy As a market-neutral trading strategy, pairs trading entails finding two co-movable stocks and establishing opposing positions in each of them in an attempt to profit from brief alterations in their historical pricing patterns. The law of mean reversion, which says that prices will eventually return to their historical mean and the trader will profit from this convergence, is the foundation of this technique.

Components of Strategy Pair Selection: Finding two stocks with a high level of co-movement and correlation is the first step in pairs trading. Usually, this entails statistical tests like cointegration and correlation coefficients.
